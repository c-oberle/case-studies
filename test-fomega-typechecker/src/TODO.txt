* Can we replace the ugly quotes ~%, ~&, ~$, ~# by V~, Q~, N~, S~?
  I got an ambiguity with V~ and application, I think.

* Proper tracking of error locations by attaching a source annotation
  to types (see TODO in typing.rules.Desugaring).

* Recursive types, i. e. substitution in types mentioned in
  premises.
