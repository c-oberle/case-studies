* Fix pretty printer: parentheses are missing. See for example
  the output Let.pts from tests.extensions.Let

* Why can't we define the entire "let-extension" in one file? See
  TODO in typing.extensions.Let.

* Can we replace the ugly quotes ~%, ~&, ~$, ~# by V~, Q~, N~, S~?
  I got an ambiguity with ~V and application, I think.

* Proper tracking of error locations by attaching a source annotation
  to types (see TODO in typing.rules.Desugaring).
