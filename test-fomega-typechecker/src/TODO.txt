* Fix pretty printer: parentheses are missing. See for example
  the output Let.pts from tests.extensions.Let.

* Can we replace the ugly quotes ~%, ~&, ~$, ~# by V~, Q~, N~, S~?
  I got an ambiguity with V~ and application, I think.

* Proper tracking of error locations by attaching a source annotation
  to types (see TODO in typing.rules.Desugaring).

* Recursive types, i. e. substitution in types mentioned in
  premises.

* A (bogus) type rule like

    ~C |- ~e1 : forall ~%X::~K1. ~T2
    ~C |- ~e2 : forall ~%Y::~K1. ~T2
    ================================ T-Bogus
    ~C |- ~e1 ~e2 : Nat

  currently does not work. Intuitively, both forall
  types denote the same type but the translation will
  not detect this alpha-equivalence.
